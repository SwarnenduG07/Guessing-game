# Guessing-game is a game made in rust 
# Hereâ€™s how it works: the program will generate a random
# integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a
# guess. After entering a guess, it will indicate whether the guess is too
# low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print congratulations and exit.
